# priconne-autowatch-script
Simple python bot for Princess Connect that automates watching scenes to get gems, using the pyautogui library


## Limitations
 * Most likely only works on pc, unless python somehow runs on android - use an emulator
 * Only completes that section, eg: all character stories only
 * Not a passive program, meaning it runs in foreground, so use it when you go for a bathroom break or breakfast
 
## How to use
 * Of course have python and pip installed
   * https://www.python.org/downloads/
   * https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
 * Download all files here
 * Install dependencies before running main.py
   * pip install pyautogui
   * pip install pynput
 * go to any story section
 * run main.py
 
## To-Do 
 * Auto go-back to watch other sections

Just trowing random stuff that works at random ehe
